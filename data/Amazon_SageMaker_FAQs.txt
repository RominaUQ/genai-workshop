What is the service availability of Amazon SageMaker?
 Amazon SageMaker is designed for high availability. There are no maintenance windows or scheduled downtimes. SageMaker APIs run in Amazon’s proven, high-availability data centers, with service stack replication configured across three facilities in each AWS Region to provide fault tolerance in the event of a server failure or Availability Zone outage.
How does Amazon SageMaker secure my code? Amazon SageMaker stores code in ML storage volumes, secured by security groups and optionally encrypted at rest.
What security measures does Amazon SageMaker have? Amazon SageMaker ensures that ML model artifacts and other system artifacts are encrypted in transit and at rest. Requests to the SageMaker API and console are made over a secure (SSL) connection. You pass AWS Identity and Access Management roles to SageMaker to provide permissions to access resources on your behalf for training and deployment. You can use encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets for model artifacts and data, as well as pass an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to SageMaker notebooks, training jobs, and endpoints, to encrypt the attached ML storage volume. Amazon SageMaker also supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and AWS PrivateLink support.
Does Amazon SageMaker use or share models, training data, or algorithms? Amazon SageMaker does not use or share customer models, training data, or algorithms. We know that customers care deeply about privacy and data security. That's why AWS gives you ownership and control over your content through simple, powerful tools that allow you to determine where your content will be stored, secure your content in transit and at rest, and manage your access to AWS services and resources for your users. We also implement responsible and sophisticated technical and physical controls that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your content. As a customer, you maintain ownership of your content, and you select which AWS services can process, store, and host your content. We do not access your content for any purpose without your consent.
How am I charged for Amazon SageMaker?
 You pay for ML compute, storage, and data processing resources you use for hosting the notebook, training the model, performing predictions, and logging the outputs. Amazon SageMaker allows you to select the number and type of instance used for the hosted notebook, training, and model hosting. You pay only for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments. See the Amazon SageMaker pricing page and the Amazon SageMaker Pricing calculator for details.
How can I optimize my Amazon SageMaker costs, such as detecting and stopping idle resources in order to avoid unnecessary charges? There are several best practices you can adopt to optimize your Amazon SageMaker resource utilization. Some approaches involve configuration optimizations; others involve programmatic solutions. A full guide on this concept, complete with visual tutorials and code samples, can be found in this blog post.
What if I have my own notebook, training, or hosting environment? Amazon SageMaker provides a full end-to-end workflow, but you can continue to use your existing tools with SageMaker. You can easily transfer the results of each stage in and out of SageMaker as your business requirements dictate.
Is R supported with Amazon SageMaker? Yes, R is supported with Amazon SageMaker. You can use R within SageMaker notebook instances, which include a preinstalled R kernel and the reticulate library. Reticulate offers an R interface for the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, enabling ML practitioners to build, train, tune, and deploy R models. 

How can I check for imbalances in my model? Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve model transparency by detecting statistical bias across the entire ML workflow. SageMaker Clarify checks for imbalances during data preparation, after training, and ongoing over time, and also includes tools to help explain ML models and their predictions. Findings can be shared through explainability reports.
What kind of bias does Amazon SageMaker Clarify detect? Measuring bias in ML models is a first step to mitigating bias. Bias may be measured before training and after training, as well as for inference for a deployed model. Each measure of bias corresponds to a different notion of fairness. Even considering simple notions of fairness leads to many different measures applicable in various contexts. You need to choose bias notions and metrics that are valid for the application and the situation under investigation. SageMaker currently supports the computation of different bias metrics for training data (as part of SageMaker data preparation), for the trained model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Experiments), and for inference for a deployed model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor). For example, before training, we provide metrics for checking whether the training data is representative (that is, whether one group is underrepresented) and whether there are differences in the label distribution across groups. After training or during deployment, metrics can be helpful to measure whether (and by how much) the performance of the model differs across groups. For example, start by comparing the error rates (how likely a model's prediction is to differ from the true label) or break further down into precision (how likely a positive prediction is to be correct) and recall (how likely the model will correctly label a positive example).
How does Amazon SageMaker Clarify improve model explainability? Amazon SageMaker Clarify is integrated with Amazon SageMaker Experiments to provide a feature importance graph detailing the importance of each input for your model’s overall decision-making process after the model has been trained. These details can help determine if a particular model input has more influence than it should on overall model behavior. SageMaker Clarify also makes explanations for individual predictions available via an API. 
What is Amazon SageMaker Studio? Amazon SageMaker Studio provides a single, web-based visual interface where you can perform all ML development steps. SageMaker Studio gives you complete access, control, and visibility into each step required to prepare data and build, train, and deploy models. You can quickly upload data, create new notebooks, train and tune models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, compare results, and deploy models to production all in one place, making you much more productive. All ML development activities including notebooks, experiment management, automatic model creation, debugging and profiling, and model drift detection can be performed within the unified SageMaker Studio visual interface.
What is RStudio on Amazon SageMaker? RStudio on Amazon SageMaker is the first fully managed RStudio Workbench in the cloud. You can quickly launch the familiar RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) and dial up and down the underlying compute resources without interrupting your work, making it easy to build machine learning (ML) and analytics solutions in R at scale.
